I've used webpack during the bootcamp in Le Wagon but it is my firstime I use it from scratch.

I couldn't achieve to make it work properly even I tried to get as far as possible.


I wanted to test with Jasmine but I didn't have time to learn it and implement it as I should (testing is basic and
I use to work during the bootcamp in Ruby with the Rspec)

I worked for 2 days in the project (16 hours in total)

I want to thank you for the opportunity to do this test!
