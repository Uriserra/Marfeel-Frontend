I've used webpack during the bootcamp in Le Wagon but it is my firstime I use it from scratch.

I couldn't achieve to make it work properly even I tried to get as far as possible.


I trid to test with Jasmine but It was my frist time in Javascript.
I used to work during the bootcamp in Ruby with the Rspec

I worked for 2 days in the project (14 hours in total)

I want to thank you for the opportunity to do this test!
